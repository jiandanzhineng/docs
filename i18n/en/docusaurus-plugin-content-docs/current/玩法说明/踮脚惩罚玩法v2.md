## 🎮 Detailed Gameplay
### 📋 Game Preparation
#### 1. Device Configuration
The system automatically connects four core devices:

+ 🔒 **Auto Lock**: Locks at game start to prevent quitting mid-game (optional device).
+ ⚡ **Shock Device**: Provides instant feedback/punishment.
+ 📡 **QTZ Laser Sensor**: Monitors whether heels are lowered via dual buttons (placed under the heels).
+ 🎮 **TD01 Device**: Optional enhancement device. Activates after no shock is triggered for a set duration, gradually increasing intensity to interfere with tiptoeing.

#### 2. Parameter Settings
Customize game difficulty:

+ **Game Duration**: Adjustable from 1-360 minutes.
+ **Shock Intensity**: Levels 10-100.
+ **Progressive Mode**: More violations lead to heavier punishments.
+ **Safety Limit**: Option to allow exceeding the 30V safety limit.
+ **Manual Start**: Option to wait for a button press on the auto_lock device to begin the game.
+ **TD01 Delay**: Adjustable from 1-60 seconds, how long after no shock triggers before TD01 starts.
+ **TD01 Intensity Increment**: Intensity value added every 5 seconds (1-100).

## 🎯 Specific Gameplay
### Core Rules
Maintain a tiptoe standing posture, heels absolutely must not touch the ground!

#### 1. Game Start
+ System auto-locks (if auto-lock device is present), preventing mid-game exit.
+ If manual start mode is enabled, a button press on the auto_lock device is required to start the timer.
+ Timer starts, requiring maintenance of tiptoe posture.
+ QTZ sensor begins real-time monitoring of heel position.

#### 2. Monitoring Mechanism
+ The sensor has two button detection points (button0 and button1).
+ Pressing down on either button with a heel = violation.
+ System immediately triggers shock punishment.
+ Shock only stops when both buttons are *not* pressed.

#### 3. Punishment System
+ 🔴 **Instant Punishment**: Shock begins the moment a heel presses a button.
+ 📈 **Progressive Intensity**: More violations cause shock intensity to automatically increase.
+ ⏱️ **Continuous Punishment**: Shock continues as long as a button is pressed, stopping only upon complete release.
+ 🎮 **TD01 Enhanced Punishment**: The TD01 device activates after a specified period without shock triggers, with intensity increasing every 5 seconds.

#### 4. TD01 Device Mechanism
+ **Delayed Start**: Automatically starts after a specified number of seconds without shock triggers.
+ **Intensity Increment**: Automatically increases by the set intensity value every 5 seconds.
+ **Maximum Intensity**: Supports range 0-255, unaffected by safety limits.
+ **Auto-Stop**: Automatically stops and resets when a shock is triggered.

#### 5. Game End
+ Automatically unlocks after persisting for the set duration.
+ System displays a comprehensive performance report.
+ Statistics on violation count, shock count, etc., are shown.

## 💪 Challenge Points
+ **Physical Challenge**: Prolonged tiptoe standing tests leg muscle endurance.
+ **Willpower Test**: Maintaining proper posture even when fatigued.
+ **Precise Control**: Any subtle heel lowering will be detected.
+ **Mind Game**: Staying calm and focused under the deterrent of shock.
+ **Dual Pressure**: Must avoid shocks while also dealing with interference from the TD01 device.

## 🏆 Victory Conditions
Successfully persist until the set time ends. Fewer violations indicate better performance:

+ 🌟 **Perfect Performance**: 0 violations.
+ ⭐ **Excellent Performance**: 1-2 violations.
