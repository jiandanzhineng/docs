## 🎮 Detailed Gameplay
### 📋 Game Preparation
#### 1. Device Configuration
The system automatically connects four core devices:

+ 🔒 **Auto-lock**: Locks at game start to prevent mid-game quitting (optional device)
+ ⚡ **Shock Device**: Provides immediate feedback/punishment
+ 📡 **QTZ Laser Sensor**: Monitors whether heels are lowered via dual buttons (placed under the heels)
+ 🎮 **TD01 Device**: Optional enhancement device. Activates after a set period without triggering shocks, gradually increasing intensity to interfere with tiptoeing.

#### 2. Parameter Settings
Game difficulty can be customized:

+ **Game Duration**: Adjustable from 1-360 minutes
+ **Shock Intensity**: Levels 10-100
+ **Progressive Mode**: Punishment severity increases with more violations
+ **Safety Limit**: Option to allow exceeding the 30V safety limit
+ **Manual Start**: Option to wait for a button press on the auto-lock device to start the game
+ **TD01 Delay**: Adjustable from 1-60 seconds (how long without shocks before TD01 activates)
+ **TD01 Intensity Increment**: Intensity value added every 5 seconds (1-100)

## 🎯 Specific Gameplay
### Core Rules
Maintain a tiptoe standing posture; heels must absolutely NOT touch the ground!

#### 1. Game Start
+ System automatically locks (if auto-lock device is present), preventing mid-game quitting
+ If manual start mode is enabled, a button press on the auto-lock device is required to start the timer
+ Timer starts; tiptoe posture must be maintained
+ QTZ sensor begins real-time monitoring of heel position

#### 2. Monitoring Mechanism
+ Sensor has two button detection points (button0 and button1)
+ Pressing down on either button with the heel = violation
+ System immediately triggers shock punishment
+ Shocks only stop when *both* buttons are released

#### 3. Punishment System
+ 🔴 **Immediate Punishment**: Shock begins the instant a heel presses a button
+ 📈 **Progressive Intensity**: Shock intensity automatically increases with more violations
+ ⏱️ **Continuous Punishment**: Shock continues as long as a button is pressed, stopping only when fully released
+ 🎮 **TD01 Enhanced Punishment**: TD01 device activates after a specified period without shocks, with intensity increasing every 5 seconds

#### 4. TD01 Device Mechanism
+ **Delayed Activation**: Automatically starts after a specified number of seconds without shocks
+ **Intensity Increment**: Automatically adds the set intensity value every 5 seconds
+ **Maximum Intensity**: Supports range 0-255, unaffected by safety limits
+ **Automatic Stop**: Automatically stops and resets when a shock is triggered

#### 5. Game End
+ Automatically unlocks after the set time is reached
+ System displays a complete performance report
+ Statistics include violation count, shock count, etc.

## 💪 Challenge Highlights
+ **Physical Challenge**: Prolonged tiptoe standing tests leg muscle endurance
+ **Willpower Test**: Must maintain proper posture even when fatigued
+ **Precise Control**: Any slight lowering of the heel will be detected
+ **Psychological Game**: Maintaining calm and focus under the threat of shock
+ **Dual Pressure**: Must avoid shocks while also dealing with TD01 device interference

## 🏆 Victory Conditions
Successfully persist until the set time ends. Fewer violations indicate better performance:

+ 🌟 **Perfect Performance**: 0 violations
+ ⭐ **Excellent Performance**: 1-2 violations
+ 👍 **Good Performance**: 3-5 violations
+ 😅 **Needs Improvement**: More than 5 violations

## ⚠️ Safety Reminders
+ Ensure good health; no heart conditions, epilepsy, etc.
+ Recommended to start with lower intensity and shorter durations
+ Stop immediately if feeling unwell during gameplay
+ For adults 18 years and older only
+ Set shock intensity cautiously; excessively high levels may cause shock injury. Risk is borne by the user.
+ If enabling the "exceed safety limit" feature, risk is borne by the user.
+ Ensure a safe gaming environment; supervision is recommended.

## 🔧 Feature Highlights
### Manual Start Mode
+ Displays a waiting screen after game loads
+ Auto-lock device locks first
+ Requires a button press on the auto-lock device to start the game timer
+ Suitable for scenarios requiring preparation time

### Real-time Shock Mechanism
+ Continuous shock begins immediately when any button is pressed
+ Shock stops immediately when all buttons are released
+ Provides the most direct feedback mechanism

### TD01 Enhancement System
+ Optional additional challenge device
+ Increases difficulty when performance is good
+ Gradually increasing intensity adds game tension
+ Supports independent intensity control
