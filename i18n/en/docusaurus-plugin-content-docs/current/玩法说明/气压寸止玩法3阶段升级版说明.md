# Air Pressure Edging Gameplay - 3-Phase Upgraded Version

## Introduction
This is an edging training gameplay based on an air pressure sensor. The system intelligently adjusts vibration intensity according to the pressure value, guiding the user to stay on the edge of excitement. When the pressure exceeds a critical threshold, an electric shock punishment is triggered.

## Game Flow
The game consists of the following state cycle:

![Flow Diagram](./img/cunzhi3phase.jpg)

1. **Calm Period (Initial/Sub Calm)**
   - Vibration intensity slowly increases, accompanied by random disturbances.
   - **Goal**: Increase arousal and raise pressure.
   - **Transition**: Enter the Middle Period when pressure exceeds the "Middle Pressure".

2. **Middle Period**
   - Intelligent control: Higher pressure leads to lower vibration intensity (to prevent rapid climax); lower pressure leads to higher vibration intensity (to maintain excitement).
   - **Transition**:
     - Pressure >= "Critical Pressure": Trigger **electric shock** and enter the Edging Period.
     - Pressure < "Middle Pressure": Fall back to the Calm Period.

3. **Edging Period**
   - **Electric shock triggered**! Vibration stops.
   - **Transition**: After pressure drops below the critical value, enter the Cooling Delay.

4. **Delay Period**
   - Wait for a period of time (cooling delay).
   - **Transition**: After the delay ends, decide whether to return to the Middle Period (if pressure > Middle Pressure) or the Calm Period (if pressure < Middle Pressure) based on the current pressure.

## Required Equipment
1. **Air Pressure Sensor (QIYA)**: Required. Used to monitor arousal level.
2. **Eccentric Motor Controller (TD01)**: Required. Used to provide vibration stimulation.
3. **Electric Shock Device (DIANJI)**: Optional. Used for edging punishment.
4. **Automatic Lock (ZIDONGSUO)**: Optional. Automatically locks at game start and unlocks at game end.

## Instructions for Use

1. Complete the assembly of the air pressure device and connect all devices to the network.
2. Insert the air pressure device into the body, typically inflating to 20-25 kPa. Ensure the pressure is appropriately low when lightly pressed to allow noticeable pressure changes, which helps slow down air leakage.
3. Set the Middle Pressure and Critical Pressure. For first-time players, you can adjust these while playing. Lower them if you can't hold back, or raise them if you feel no sensation.
