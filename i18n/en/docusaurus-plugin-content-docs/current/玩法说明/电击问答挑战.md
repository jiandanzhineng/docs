{
  "title": "Maid Behavior Standard Exam Question Bank",
  "description": "Contains questions on maid behavior standards, etiquette norms, and obedience tests",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "When the Master wants tea, what is your correct action?",
      "options": [
        "Quickly run to the kitchen to make tea, bring it over, and place it on the table",
        "Ask the Master what kind of tea and how much sugar they want",
        "Place the made tea on a delicate tray, kneel, and hold the tray up with both hands at an appropriate height in front of the Master",
        "Quietly wait for the Master to call again"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A is the method of an ordinary servant. B asks too many questions before a clear command is given, showing disobedience. C demonstrates the standard serving posture (kneeling, holding with both hands) and emphasizes a sense of ceremony. D is too passive."
    },
    {
      "question": "Regardless of what you are doing, when you clearly hear the Master call your name or title 'XX, come here', you should?",
      "options": [
        "Finish what you are doing first, then go over",
        "Immediately answer loudly 'I'm coming!', then run over quickly",
        "Immediately answer clearly 'Yes, Master!', and quickly reach the specified position in front of the Master with a proper, small-step fast-walk posture",
        "Stay quiet and quickly walk to the Master's side, standing with head bowed"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A violates the principle of 'immediate response'. B's response is not formal enough (lacks 'Yes, Master'), and the movement/posture is not proper. C fully complies with the requirement of 'instant response + formal language + standard movement'. D lacks the necessary verbal response."
    },
    {
      "question": "While serving the Master, if you accidentally drop the Master's valuable item (like a book) on the floor, you should?",
      "options": [
        "Quickly pick it up, put it back, and pretend nothing happened",
        "Immediately apologize 'Sorry, Master!', then pick it up and put it back",
        "Immediately assume a proper kneeling posture beside the item, lower your head, and clearly request punishment: 'Your servant/slave made a mistake, please punish me, Master!'",
        "Panic and explain: 'Sorry, Master! My hand slipped...'"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A hides the mistake and is dishonest. B's apology is not formal and lacks an attitude of accepting punishment. C shows the correct posture for admitting fault (proper kneeling) and language (clearly admitting mistake + requesting punishment), which is the most appropriate way to show obedience and take responsibility. D is too panicked, and the explanation is redundant and may be seen as making excuses."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the morning, you need to wake the Master. You should?",
      "options": [
        "Gently knock on the door, and after receiving permission, enter and draw the curtains",
        "Set an alarm clock and let it wake the Master",
        "Stand by the bed and softly call: 'Master, it's time to wake up'",
        "5 minutes before the Master's set wake-up time, kneel by the bedside and softly call: 'Master, the time has arrived, your servant/slave is here to serve.' Wait until the Master opens their eyes and gives a clear instruction"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A is too ordinary, lacking a sense of ceremony. B is not hands-on and shows no initiative in service. C is not formal or standard enough. D demonstrates: preparing in advance (on time), the correct serving posture (kneeling at the side), clear wake-up words, and quietly waiting for the next instruction, which is the highest standard of service."
    },
    {
      "question": "The Master asks you to pass him his tie. How should you deliver it?",
      "options": [
        "Find the tie, walk over, and hand it to the Master",
        "Find the tie, hold it with both hands, and give it to the Master",
        "Carefully fold the tie or place it on a small tray, walk to the specified position in front of the Master (e.g., one step ahead), stand/kneel properly, lower your head, and respectfully present it with both hands held up",
        "Directly drape the tie over the back of a chair to remind the Master"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A and B lack detail (not arranging/using a tray) and proper posture (not standing/kneeling in position, not lowering head or presenting with hands held up), appearing casual. C fully includes elements like arranging, a container (optional but recommended), specific position, standard posture (standing or kneeling, lowering head, presenting with hands held up). D is extremely casual and disrespectful."
    },
    {
      "question": "The Master is having a serious conversation with a guest, and you need to refill the Master's tea. You should?",
      "options": [
        "Walk straight over and fill the Master's cup",
        "Quietly walk to an appropriate distance behind and to the side of the Master, kneel properly and wait. When there is a brief pause in the Master's conversation or a glance of indication, quickly approach (maintaining kneeling posture) and gently add tea",
        "Ask the Master: 'Master, shall I refill your tea?'",
        "Do not refill the tea for now; wait until they finish talking"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A directly interrupts, which is extremely rude. C asking during a serious conversation interrupts the Master's train of thought and is inappropriate. D is not timely service and not proactive enough. B demonstrates: entering quietly, maintaining presence but staying low-key (waiting at the side/rear), obedient posture (kneeling and waiting), seizing the right moment (pause or indication), and standard action (adding tea while kneeling), which is the most appropriate and non-disruptive way of serving."
    },
    {
      "question": "During dinner, if the Master has not started eating or given you explicit permission to eat, you should?",
      "options": [
        "Stand far away from the table and wait",
        "Sit in your own seat but do not touch the utensils",
        "Kneel at a position to the side and rear of the Master's chair, serving quietly",
        "Ask softly: 'Master, may I start eating?'"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A is too far away and inconvenient for serving. B is not allowed as the Master has not given permission (unless the Master has explicit rules allowing the maid to sit at the table). D is inappropriate as actively asking for permission to eat during a formal dinner is not proper. C indicates a clear position (side/rear of Master), posture (kneeling), duty (ready to serve at any time), and implies the rule of eating only when permitted by the Master."
    },
    {
      "question": "As stipulated by the Master: what is your standard standing serving posture when there is no specific task instruction?",
      "options": [
        "Stand casually and comfortably",
        "Stand at attention, eyes fixed straight ahead",
        "Heels together, toes naturally apart at a small angle, hands clasped in front at the lower abdomen, back straight, chin slightly tucked, gaze maintaining a respectful posture on the ground in front of the Master's feet",
        "Stand with hands on hips, ready for action at any time"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A is too casual. B is too rigid and militaristic, lacking the soft, respectful feeling characteristic of 'maid service'. C describes a classic maid standing posture that embodies humility and readiness. D appears arrogant and rude."
    },
    {
      "question": "The Master says to you: 'You dressed very appropriately today, good job.' How should you respond?",
      "options": [
        "Say happily: 'Thank you for the praise, Master!'",
        "Say modestly: 'It's what I should do.'",
        "Smile and say: 'As long as the Master is satisfied.'",
        "Assume a proper posture (e.g., kneel/stand properly), respond clearly: 'It is the Master's grace/bounty.' and maintain a grateful expression"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A, B, C are ordinary thanks and do not reflect the attribute of being owned (the root of dressing appropriately is the Master's taste or grace). D emphasizes the Master's power and ownership through language (attributing credit to the Master's 'grace/bounty') and posture (maintaining a respectful posture)."
    },
    {
      "question": "As stipulated by the Master, the maid uniform must include which element to constantly signify identity?",
      "options": [
        "Beautiful and delicate lace trim",
        "An apron and headscarf for convenient work",
        "An apron/collar/cufflinks imprinted with the Master's specific emblem",
        "Expensive and luxurious fabric"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A, B, D are merely common or functional/aesthetic elements of a maid uniform. C mentions the 'Master's specific emblem' (e.g., family crest, specific symbol, even a collar), which directly marks ownership and is the core visual symbol emphasizing ownership and identity in an SM context."
