# Kegel Exercise Gameplay

# Gameplay Overview
+ Kegel training alternates between "Relaxation Phase" and "Kegel Phase"
+ The goal is to complete as many "successful Kegels" as possible within the set time
+ Success or failure is visually indicated on the interface; failure triggers electric shock (if connected and enabled)

# Equipment & Preparation
+ Required Device: `Air Pressure Sensor (QIYA)`
+ Optional Devices: `Electric Shock Device (DIANJI)`, `Automatic Lock (ZIDONGSUO)`

## Device Assembly
Detach the inflator bulb from the inflatable anal plug. Connect it to the rubber tube of the air pressure sensor, and connect the anal plug's rubber tube to the tee joint of the pressure sensor.

1. Original state of the anal plug upon receipt (new version has a modified design for better sealing, similar to below)

2. Remove the inflator bulb

5. Optional enhancement if pressure leak seems fast

Tighten this clamp at the connection point to reduce pressure leak speed.

# Parameter Description
+ `Duration (minutes)`: Total length of the session.
+ `Kegel Count Goal`: Desired number of successful completions, used for total progress display.
+ `Pressure Change (kPa)`: The required pressure increase threshold during the Kegel phase (relative to the lowest pressure in the relaxation phase).
+ `Shock Intensity (V)`: Electric shock intensity upon failure.
+ `Shock Duration (seconds)`: Duration of electric shock upon failure.
+ `Single Cycle Time (seconds)`: Duration of each phase, default 10 seconds (Relax 10s → Kegel 10s → Repeat).

# Gameplay Flow
+ Relaxation Phase
    - Relax and breathe naturally. The system records the "lowest pressure" of this phase as a reference.
    - After the countdown ends, enter the Kegel phase.
+ Kegel Phase
    - Within this phase's duration, increase the pressure to "Lowest Pressure + Pressure Change".
    - Reaching the target is judged as "Achieved", but you must wait for this phase's countdown to finish before moving to the next round.
    - If the target is not met before the phase ends, it's judged "Challenge Failed · Starting Shock" (if shock device is available).
+ Phase Alternation
    - Each round cycles as "Relax → Kegel → Relax → …" until time runs out or the target count is reached.

# Interface Indicators
+ Large text at the top shows the current phase (Relaxation Phase/Kegel Phase) and the remaining time for this phase.
+ Overall Progress
    - Count-based progress bar: Completed Count / Target Count
    - Time-based progress bar: Elapsed Time / Total Duration
+ Pressure & Target
    - Current Pressure (kPa)
    - Minimum Relaxation Pressure (Reference Value)
    - Kegel Target Pressure (Minimum Pressure + Pressure Change)
+ Success/Failure Indicator
    - Success: A green capsule "Achieved" appears next to the number.
    - Failure: A red capsule "Challenge Failed · Starting Shock" appears next to the number.
+ Controls & Log
    - Buttons: Pause, Manual Shock
    - Log: Displays recent messages and system prompts.

**Finish & Statistics**

+ Ends when the set duration is reached or the success count meets the goal.
+ Automatically unlocks on finish (if automatic lock is connected).
+ Interface displays cumulative success count and shock count, etc.

**Usage Recommendations**

+ For first-time use, it's recommended to set a lower "Pressure Change" to get familiar with the rhythm.
+ If using an electric shock device, start with low intensity and adjust gradually.
+ Maintain steady breathing, focus on increasing pressure to the target during the Kegel phase.

**Quick Start Guide**

+ Connect the air pressure sensor (optionally connect shock device, automatic lock).
+ Set parameters and start.
+ Relax during the Relaxation Phase, no effort needed; wait for countdown. Apply force during the Kegel Phase to reach the target.
+ Upon seeing "Achieved", maintain until the phase ends; failure triggers prompt and shock.
+ Repeat cycle until finish, review statistics and progress bars to see results.
