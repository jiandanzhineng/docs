# Pelvic Floor Training Gameplay

# Gameplay Overview
+ Pelvic floor training alternates between "Relaxation Phase" and "Contraction Phase"
+ The goal is to achieve as many "Successful Contractions" as possible within the set time
+ Success or failure is visually indicated on the interface; failure triggers an electric shock (if connected and enabled)

# Equipment & Preparation
+ Required Equipment: `Air Pressure Sensor (QIYA)`
+ Optional Equipment: `Electric Shock Device (DIANJI)`, `Automatic Lock (ZIDONGSUO)`

## Device Assembly
Detach the inflator bulb from the inflatable anal plug and connect it to the air tube of the pressure sensor. Connect the anal plug's air tube to the T-connector of the pressure sensor.

1. How the anal plug looks upon arrival (new version has changed appearance, better sealing, similar to below)

2. Detach the inflator bulb

5. Optional enhancement if pressure leaks too quickly

Tighten this clamp at the connection point to reduce pressure leakage speed.

# Parameter Description
+ `Duration (minutes)`: Total game session length
+ `Contraction Count Target`: Desired number of successful contractions, used to display overall progress
+ `Pressure Change (kPa)`: The pressure increase threshold required during the contraction phase (relative to the lowest pressure in the relaxation phase)
+ `Shock Intensity (V)`: Electric shock intensity upon failure
+ `Shock Duration (seconds)`: Duration of electric shock upon failure
+ `Single Cycle Time (seconds)`: Duration of each phase, default 10 seconds (Relax 10s → Contract 10s → Cycle)

# Gameplay Flow
+ Relaxation Phase
    - Relax and breathe naturally; the system records the "Lowest Pressure" of this phase as a reference
    - After the countdown ends, enter the contraction phase
+ Contraction Phase
    - Need to increase the pressure to "Lowest Pressure + Pressure Change" within the duration of this phase
    - Reaching the target is judged as "Achieved", but you still need to wait for this phase's countdown to end before entering the next round
    - If the target is not met before the phase ends, it's judged as "Challenge Failed · Starting Shock" (if shock device is available)
+ Phase Alternation
    - Each round cycles as "Relax → Contract → Relax → …" until time ends or the target count is reached

# Interface Indicators
+ Large text at the top shows the current phase (Relaxation Phase/Contraction Phase) and remaining time for this phase
+ Overall Progress
    - Count-based progress bar: Completed Count / Target Count
    - Time-based progress bar: Elapsed Time / Total Duration
+ Pressure & Target
    - Current Pressure (kPa)
    - Lowest Relaxation Pressure (Reference Value)
    - Contraction Target Pressure (Lowest Pressure + Pressure Change)
+ Success/Failure Indicators
    - Success: Green capsule "Achieved" displayed after the number
    - Failure: Red capsule "Challenge Failed · Starting Shock" displayed after the number
+ Operations & Log
    - Buttons: Pause, Manual Shock
    - Log: Displays recent messages and system prompts

**End & Statistics**

+ Ends when the set duration is reached or the success count meets the target
+ Auto-unlock at end (if automatic lock is connected)
+ Interface displays cumulative success count and shock count, etc.

**Usage Suggestions**

+ For first-time use, it's recommended to set "Pressure Change" lower to get familiar with the rhythm
+ If connecting a shock device, start with low intensity and adjust gradually
+ Maintain steady breathing; focus on increasing pressure to the target during the contraction phase

**Quick Start Guide**

+ Connect the pressure sensor (optionally connect shock device, automatic lock)
+ Set parameters and start
+ Relaxation phase requires no effort, wait for countdown; Contraction phase requires effort to reach the target
+ Seeing "Achieved" means you can maintain until this phase ends; failure triggers a prompt and shock
+ Repeat the cycle until the end, check statistics and progress bars to understand completion status
