# Push-up (Approximate) Detection Training Game

A push-up training game based on distance sensors, using QTZ distance sensors to detect push-up completion, combined with automatic locks, electric shock, and vibrator devices for training incentives and punishment mechanisms.

A small stick can be added to the mouth~ to create a new gameplay = =

## Game Overview
### Game Objectives
+ Complete the specified number of push-ups within the set time
+ Maintain standard push-up posture
+ Enhance training effectiveness and focus through device feedback

### Game Mechanics
1. **Game Start**: The automatic lock device locks, and timing and action detection begin
2. **Action Detection**: QTZ distance sensor monitors body height changes in real-time
3. **Completion Judgment**: Body descending below the set distance is considered "down," and rising above the set distance is considered "up"
4. **Punishment Mechanism**: Prolonged inactivity triggers random intensity and duration electric shock punishment
5. **Reward Interference**: After consecutively completing a specified number, each completion has a probability of triggering vibrator interference
6. **State Reset**: After being punished, the consecutive completion count resets to zero, and reward judgment restarts
7. **Game End**: Automatically unlocks when the target count is reached or time expires
