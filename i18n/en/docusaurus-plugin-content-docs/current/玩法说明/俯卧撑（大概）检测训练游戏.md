# Push-up (Approximately) Detection Training Game

A push-up training game based on a distance sensor. It uses the QTZ distance sensor to detect the completion of push-up movements, combined with automatic locks, electric shock, and vibrator devices for training incentives and punishment mechanisms.

A small stick can be added to the mouth to create a new gameplay style.

## Game Overview
### Game Objectives
+ Complete a specified number of push-ups within the set time.
+ Maintain a standard push-up posture.
+ Enhance training effectiveness and focus through device feedback.

### Game Mechanics
1. **Game Start**: The automatic lock device engages, starting the timer and movement detection.
2. **Movement Detection**: The QTZ distance sensor monitors changes in body height in real time.
3. **Completion Judgment**: The body descending below the set distance is considered "down", and rising above the set distance is considered "up".
4. **Punishment Mechanism**: Inactivity for an extended period triggers random intensity and duration electric shock punishment.
5. **Reward Interference**: After consecutively completing a specified number, each subsequent completion has a chance to trigger vibrator interference.
6. **State Reset**: After being punished, the consecutive completion count resets to zero, restarting the reward judgment.
7. **Game End**: Automatic unlock upon reaching the target count or when time expires.
