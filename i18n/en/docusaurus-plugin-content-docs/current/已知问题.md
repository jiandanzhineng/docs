# Known Issues

1. Device network configuration may fail on some routers. In such cases, you can use a mobile phone to create a Wi-Fi hotspot for setup.
2. When the device is first received, if network configuration fails or the device does not come online after configuration, it may be due to low battery. Try charging it for a while or plugging it in, then power cycling the device.
3. Ensure a stable network environment before enabling mDNS, otherwise it may cause abnormal mDNS domain binding (e.g., in mobile hotspot environments, connect to the hotspot first before enabling mDNS).
4. If the network configuration button is grayed out after connecting the device to a phone, try restarting the phone.
5. In hotspot connection mode, depending on the quality of the network card, there may be brief action delays at intervals.
