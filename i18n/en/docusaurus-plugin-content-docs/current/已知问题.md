# Known Issues

1. Device network configuration may fail under certain routers; you can try using a mobile hotspot as an alternative.
2. If the device fails to configure the network or does not come online after configuration when first received, it may be due to low battery. Try charging it for a while or keeping it plugged in, then power cycle the device.
3. Ensure a stable network condition before enabling mDNS, otherwise it may cause abnormal mDNS domain binding (e.g., in mobile hotspot environments, connect to the hotspot first before enabling mDNS).
4. If the network configuration button appears grayed out after the phone connects to the device, try restarting the phone.
5. In hotspot connection mode, limited by the quality of the network card, there may be occasional short delays in actions over time.
